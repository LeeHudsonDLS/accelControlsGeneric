All insertion device front ends will be carried into diamond 2, some of them that have 2 branches (i04 i04.1 i20-1 i20-2) will have one in the K straight. 

These only had one FE anyway, will i04 change to k04 etc? 
Is this just a name change or physical location change?

K04 and K14 flagship FEs. Just mechanical upgrades? I think so

K07 = B07
